Snake Game in Python (Pygame)
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Python pygame library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen to collect apples. Every time the snake eats an apple, it grows in length. The game continues until the player exits manually.

Randomly spawning apples

Snake grows upon eating an apple

Game window updates at a consistent frame rate

Game Mechanics
The snake starts at a fixed position and moves in a default direction (right).

The apple appears randomly on the grid.

When the snake's head touches the apple, the snake grows and a new apple spawns.

If the player closes the window, the game exits.

To Do / Future Improvements
Add collision detection with the snake's own body or walls to end the game

Display score

Add start and game-over screens

Sound effects and background music

Improve graphics and animations
